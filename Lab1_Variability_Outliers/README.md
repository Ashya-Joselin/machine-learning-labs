## 📊 Tasks Overview

This lab involves the following tasks based on the provided instructions :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}:

1. Creating a box plot for a simple numeric dataset.
2. Analyzing calories dataset (Vanilla ice cream) for:
   - Mean, Median, Mode
   - Five-point summary
   - Outliers
3. Detecting outliers in `Lab1_Tips.csv` using Pandas boxplot.
4. Group-wise boxplot visualization for total bill by day.
5. Using Seaborn for enhanced boxplots.
6. Variability analysis on `Lab1_StudentsPerformance.csv` dataset:
   - Selecting numeric features
   - Generating summary statistics
   - Plotting variability using Seaborn
7. Exercise:
   - Apply variability analysis to `tips.csv` dataset
   - Compute summary statistics
   - Boxplot visualization

## 📝 Key Observations
- Box plots provide an effective visual summary of central tendency and dispersion.
- Whiskers indicate spread and potential outliers.
- Outliers appear as individual points beyond whiskers.
- Different numeric fields may show different levels of variability (e.g., `total_bill` > `tip` > `size`).
- Variability analysis helps in understanding dataset behavior before modeling.
